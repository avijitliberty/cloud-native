## Overview

Crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT is important to unlock its potential. Longer prompts with more information and detailed instructions are better than short, generic ones.
 
The ```Context```‚û°Ô∏è ```Task```‚û°Ô∏è```Instruction```‚û°Ô∏è```Clarify```‚û°Ô∏è```Refine``` technique is a simple and powerful method for creating exceptional prompts that deliver unique and accurate responses. It gives ChatGPT a clearer understanding of what to do.

  Providing ```context``` is important when asking questions to **ChatGPT** as it helps to provide a foundation for targeted answers. Without context, the response may not be relevant or helpful, similar to a conversation with a friend. Providing **background** information helps to ensure that the question is understood and allows for a more appropriate and useful response.

  Clear instructions are necessary for ChatGPT to generate text effectively. Without a specific ```task```, it may produce irrelevant or off-topic text. Providing a clear task helps to narrow down the scope and produce more **focused** text. Therefore, prompts should specify the **outcome** or **goal** of the task.

Once you have outlined the task, be sure to provide detailed ```instructions```. This could include the overall tone of the post, its length, who it should be aimed at and any other relevant details. 

Doing this will ensure that ChatGPT understands your ```expectations``` so it can generate a response that meets your needs

For example: "The item should be approximately 500 words long and written in a
conversational style that resonates with beginners in **meditation**."

This part is quite simple, simply ask ChatGPT whether it understands the context,
task and instruction. It should repeat your prompt back to you to demonstrates that
it comprehends the task.

If you're not satisfied with ChatGPT's response, try using prompts like "rephrase with shorter sentences" or "rewrite with natural language." Consider the tone and style of the response, and review for any errors or inconsistencies. Fact-check the information provided as ChatGPT is not always correct.
