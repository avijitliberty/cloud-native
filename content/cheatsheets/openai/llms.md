## Overview


## ChatGPT Vs Gemini

ChatGPT and Gemini are both large language models (LLMs) trained to generate human-quality text. They have access to a massive amount of text data, which allows them to generate text that is both coherent and informative.

However, there are some key differences between the two models. ChatGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer model, while Gemini is a factual language model. This means that ChatGPT is better at generating creative text formats, like poems,
code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc., while Gemini is better at providing summaries of factual topics or creating different kinds of creative text formats.
