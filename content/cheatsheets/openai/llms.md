## Overview

###### Artificial Intelligence
AI is when machines learn, think, and do things that usually need human intelligence. It's like having a robot assistant that can help you!

###### Generative Al
Generative Al refers to Artificial Intelligence that can generate ```new content or data``` that resembles **human-generated** examples.

###### Large Language Models 
Large language models (**LLMs**) are a type of ```Generative AI``` that are trained on massive amounts of text data. They can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.
 
**LLMs** are linked to Al in several ways:

* They are trained using Al techniques, such as deep learning.
* They are used to perform AI tasks, such as natural languagem processing (```NLP```).
* They are often used in conjunction with other Al systems, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. 

LLMs are a rapidly developing area of Al research, and they are being used to power a wide range of new and innovative applications. As LLMs ontinue to improve, they are likely to play an even greater role in the future of Al.

## ChatGPT Vs Gemini

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) and [Gemini]() are both large language models (LLMs) trained to generate human-quality text. They have access to a massive amount of text data, which allows them to generate text that is both coherent and informative.

However, there are some key differences between the two models. ChatGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer model, while Gemini is a factual language model. This means that ChatGPT is better at generating creative text formats, like poems,
code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc., while Gemini is better at providing summaries of factual topics or creating different kinds of creative text formats.
